So, having toyed with nltk for a bit, I decided I could use it asa base to code up a simple summarizer.  It can be downloaded fromhere:http://tristanhavelick.com/summarize.zip (basic usage can be found intest/summarize.doctest as well as at the end of this document)I took the algorithm from the Java library Classifier4J here:http://classifier4j.sourceforge.net/ but I hesitate to call it a portof that package, as I have (1) Used nltk wherever possible to do things like find wordfrequencies and tokenize sentences rather than porting Classifier4J'sinternal methods for doing such things (2) Used a more python-like coding style, than a Java/C# style (3) Tried to keep file formatting, unit tests and other style aspectsas similar to those used by nltk internally as I could.I plan to officially release this code under some kind of open sourcelicense soon, but I was curious if it would be appropriate to have ifreleased as part of nltk itself.  It seems appropriate as it is afairly common NLP action, and other libraries that do similar thingsto nltk (such a lemur and mahout) have summarization capabilities.Take a look and let me know what you think.  I've really enjoyingworking with nltk, and I'd love to hear if I'd be able to bringanything to the table, this package or otherwise.",
